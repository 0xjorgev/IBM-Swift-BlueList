Topcoder Challenge: bluelist-mobiledata-iOS 8 Swift
===

This is an extension of the original BlueList project provided by IBM, this version of the project provides:

- Interactive Push notifications added with IBM Push Services and IBM Cloudcode
- Sorted items based on priority values
- Today's Extension that shows the first 4 items of the sorted list

These samples work with the Mobile Cloud, an application boilerplate that is available on [IBM Bluemix](https://www.ng.bluemix.net).  With this boilerplate, you can quickly incorporate pre-built, managed, and scalable cloud services into your mobile applications without relying on IT involvement. You can focus on building your mobile applications rather than the complexities of managing the back end infrastructure.
